Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects. Python has become a common language for machine learning research and is the primary language for PyTorch.\n",

A non-profit organization, the Python Software Foundation (PSF), manages and directs resources for Python development. On January 1, 2020, the PSF discontinued the Python 2 language and no longer provides security patches and other improvements. Python interpreters are available for many operating systems.\n",

This method of invoking the _print_ command is no longer allowed in Python 3. Similarly, it used to be a performance improvement to use the _xrange_ command in place of range command at times. Python 3 incorporated all of the functionality of the _xrange_ Python 2 command into the normal _range_ command. As a result, the programmer should not use the _xrange_ command in Python 3. If you see either of these constructs used in example code, then you are looking at an older Python 2 era example.\n",
